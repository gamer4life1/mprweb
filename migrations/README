This directory contains Alembic's environment for managing database migrations.

From Alembic's documentation: Alembic is a lightweight database migration tool
for usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for Python.
https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/index.html


Upgrading to the latest version
-------------------------------

Simply run `alembic upgrade head` from aurweb's root.


Creating new migrations
-----------------------

When working with Alembic and SQLAlchemy, you should never edit the database
schema manually. Please proceed like this instead:

1. Edit `aurweb/schema.py` to your liking.
2. Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your message"`
3. Proofread the generated migration.
4. Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply the changes to the database.
5. Commit the new migration.

To revert a migration, you may run `alembic downgrade -1` and then manually
delete the migration file. Note that SQLite is limited and that it's sometimes
easier to recreate the database.

For anything more complicated, please read Alembic's documentation.


Troubleshooting
---------------

- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aurweb'`

  You may either install the aurweb module with pip, or set PYTHONPATH to your
  aurweb repository. Since alembic must be run from the aurweb root, you may
  simply use: `PYTHONPATH=. alembic [...]`.

- `FAILED: No config file 'alembic.ini' found, or file has no '[alembic]' section`

  You need to run Alembic from the project's root, and not from `migrations/`.

- `configparser.NoSectionError: No section: 'database'`

  You need to set AUR_CONFIG, as explained in `TESTING`.
